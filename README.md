DSP_App
=======

App to drive the DSP I added to the libeffect.so in my custom AOSP build.

I made a AOSP build and altered the libefect.so to include my own DSP. 
This app drives that DSP. 

It should crash on all devices that do not alter the libeffect.so to have the EQ include more than 5 bands.
